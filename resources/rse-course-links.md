## Summary of Research Software Engineering with Python 2022 - Online Live Course 

This document provides links to course materials for Turing's Research Software Engineering course. 


### Pre-requisites
It is helpful to have experience in at least one programming language (for example C++, C, Fortran, Python, Ruby, Matlab or R) but this is not a strict requirement.

Experience with version control and/or the Unix shell, for instance from Software Carpentry, would also be helpful.
